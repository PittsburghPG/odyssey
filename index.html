				<p><strong>How hockey, the Internet and love conspired to bring Magnus Brav to Pittsburgh:</strong></p>

				<p>The story begins in the winter of 2001&#45;02, when a friend convinced Magnus to sign up for the Pittsburgh Penguins online message board. Magnus was then a teacher in his hometown of V&#228;ster&#229;s, Sweden. On the message board, he became acquainted with a number of Pens fans. One was a Pittsburgh woman named Melissa Geisler. For years, the two sent messages back and forth.</p>

				<p>Then along came Facebook. In 2008 Magnus received a friend request from Melissa. "On Facebook we took the communication to a different level," Magnus says. "We saw eye&#45;to&#45;eye on a lot of different topics. I also thought, 'She's a very beautiful lady.'"</p>

				<p>But more than 4,000 miles separated the two.</p>

				<p>In autumn of 2009, Melissa decided to fix that problem, at least temporarily, by traveling to Sweden. "She was very afraid of flying," Magnus says, "so I always thought that was very courageous of her, to fly halfway around the world."</p>

				<p>The two attended a hockey game in Magnus' hometown and traveled to Stockholm, where they visited the hockey arena where the Pens had played the year before. </p>

				<p>The following summer, Magnus came to Pittsburgh. He celebrated the July Fourth holiday with Melissa's family and endured three weeks of the city's hot, humid weather &mdash; no small feat for a guy raised in a country where July temperatures rarely rise above the 60s.</p>

				<p>The two had to make a decision. "It just didn't feel fair to live in separate countries and see each other once a year," he said. "If you love someone, you want to live with them all the time."</p>

				<p>The two were married in Sweden on June 30, 2011. Magnus then began the process of applying for residency in the United States &mdash; a process that was completed in September 2012. </p>

				<p>"I left my family, my friends and my hometown and moved to Pittsburgh on December 23, 2012," Magnus wrote in an email describing his journey. "I moved in with my wonderful wife in the neighborhood of Troy Hill. In September last year I got a job at the Ross Target store off McKnight Road and I must say I like it and I really like all my awesome co&#45;workers."</p>

				<p>Hockey continues to play a central role in the couple's lives. In fact, they'd like to renew their wedding vows at the Consol Energy Center.</p>

				<p><strong>Most difficult adjustments:</strong> Getting accustomed to door knobs &mdash; "back home, we have door handles," Magnus says &mdash; and the American system of measurements. "In Sweden we measure by kilometer. Here it is hours &mdash; five hours to this place, three hours to that place. It really is a big country, America. It's hard for me to comprehend how big it is, coming from Sweden, with a population of 10 million people."</p>

				<p><strong>Favorite place in Pittsburgh:</strong> "I like to go up on Mount Washington and take pictures of the city and the Point. When I first got here they were still fixing up the fountain, and when they finally opened it up last year, that really added something to the landscape of the city."</p>
