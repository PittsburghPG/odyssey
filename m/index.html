				<p>Now that Nassim Merabet has lived in Pittsburgh for a couple of years, he looks back and sees the many ways he had become familiar with the Steel City when he lived in his hometown of BÃ©jaÃ¯a, Algeria.</p><p>"I remember when I was in high school we studied Pittsburgh in history class because of the steel industry," he says.  "Then I remember seeing a guy wearing the Steelers jersey. At that time, I didn't know about the Steelers, so I didn't recognize the logo, but now I know that there is one guy in my hometown who wears the Steelers jersey." </p><p>Nassim traveled from Algeria to Pittsburgh in February 2012. Unlike most immigrants who cite the breathtaking view on the exit from the Fort Pitt Tunnel as their first impression, he remembers the smell. It was unfamiliar and strong, especially when he would travel to Downtown to his work on foot or on his bicycle via the 16th Street Bridge. As Nassim learned later, it was the smell of mustard. When he told his colleague about the weird smell of mustard in the air, the colleague surmised that it must be coming from the H.J. Heinz plant. Heâ€™s not sure whether the theory was correct, but now, having acclimated himself to the city, he no longer notices the smell.  </p><p>Mustard? It may not be as unusual as it sounds for a guy sensitive to spices. In Algeria, Nassim worked as a cooking teacher in a vocational school funded by the government. Before that, he was a cook at different international hotels, like Sheraton, Marriott and Sofitel. He even had a chance to work with a French chef, who became his mentor. </p><p>"Because Algeria is a former colony of France, a lot of people have French heritage. I learned many tricks in French, Italian, Mediterranean cuisines," he says.</p><p>Now, Nassim works at UPMC Senior Communities as a cook. And for him, cooking is different than it was in Algeria. "We don't have the same taste as American people. I remember one time I cooked French onion soup for senior residents ... and back in Algeria I learned from my French mentor chef that you always put sugar into French onion soup. That's how we make it.  Everyone in the dining room complained that it was too sweet. For me it was OK -- that's how it's supposed to be -- but they couldn't eat it."</p><p>What struck Nassim about Pittsburgh is the cosmopolitan nature of the city. "When I lived in Algeria, I never met someone from India, from Russia, from Turkey. When I got here and started working at a hotel downtown, I had this opportunity to meet all these people from different countries. Then I started taking English classes, and I had classmates from Nepal, from China."</p><p>Nassim says he likes it here, wants to stay in the city, build his family in Pittsburgh and "live in love."  Life here is better than in Algeria, he says. "If you compare the U.S. to where I come from, there is no transparency, there is no democracy or good infrastructure." Professional relationships here are less hostile, he notes. "In America, the relationships between the boss and the workers are better. In Algeria, many people are greedy and people get really jealous, but here it's rare. People do not stick their noses in your affairs."</p><p>If Nassim had a better grasp of Pittsburghese, he probably would call his former Algerian colleagues nebby.</p><p>One of the things Nassim really likes about Pittsburgh is that you can find something to do here every day. People are generally friendly and the immigrant community is truly an asset. </p><p>"There are debates going on in this country about the immigration reform right now,â€ he says. â€œMany Americans, especially the conservatives, say that immigrants take our jobs away, and all of the other familiar cliches. I think if you have a lot of people from all these countries, they contribute to the richness of the community. You can always learn something new and positive from them."</p><p>Nassim says he doesn't miss Algeria all that much. He has an adventurous character and "never gets bored." </p><p>"It's easy  to complain and say that people are not good, people are racist,â€ he says. â€œBut you have to ask yourself a good question: 'Why are they like that?' It's because of fear. But that's not the way I want to be if I want to integrate. That's not the way I should be."</p>
